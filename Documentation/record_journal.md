Records of time spent and what was is spent on:

Deadline 1:

Used up a lot of time on 13.3 
(pretty much the whole time starting 4.30 pm until 8.30 with some breaks for a bus ride etc) 
The tasks were simple enough, really. However, as I am unfamiliar with using neither terminal on Uni computers nor Git Bash at home and some of the text in the deadline description was dificult for me to understand, it took an awful lot of time :C
For some reason, the git commit command was the most difficult to grasp as I am still not sure about those little commit messages.
