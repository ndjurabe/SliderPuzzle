Journal

Records of time spent and what was is spent on:

Deadline 1:

Used up a lot of time on 13.3 
(pretty much the whole time starting 4.30 pm until 8.30 with some breaks for a bus ride etc) 
The tasks were simple enough, really. However, as I am unfamiliar with using neither terminal on Uni computers nor Git Bash at home and some of the text in the deadline description was dificult for me to understand, it took an awful lot of time :C
For some reason, the git commit command was the most difficult to grasp as I am still not sure about those little commit messages. 


Deadline 2:

- On the 17.3, updated the journal with deadline 1 description (before the dirst deadline, I added the wrong, empty folder into the online repository :/)
- Added a pit-generated text document into the pit folder in documentation

Don't know how to make the tests, so just the game code for now... Not much for TDD :_D


Deadline 3: 

- 26.3 Saw how to make a test. Still not sure I have any idea I know how to make them for my game but at least I know there must be the "assert" thing :D
-made 2 tests. Still don't know how to make them for more complicated methods.

- 27.3 magically made a couple more tests. Some kept passing or failing randomly, so I took them away
- made a small class diagram
- added Pit-report.


- I'm going to have to probably re-write(or comment on) most of the code as it is very difficult to follow now (especially when trying to think of tests to check it :D)

Deadline 4:

- 1-2.4 struggled through trying to create some more tests and try to break down the bigger methods into smalled ones in the Logic class

- 3.4 spent a good while (5+ hours) on more test, more simplification of the logic class. 
- got the pit report to cover over 80%! yay! :)
- drawn something resembelling a sequence diagram. Those things always scared me and I am still not sure how to draw them ;__;
- not sure how javadoc works (there is not run->generate javadoc button nor does the command line work on my computer) so added some javadoc type text manually...
- feels like progress has been made :)

Deadline 6:

- 23.4 fixed the game's end. Now as the last correct move is made, the program gives a popup message about winning.
